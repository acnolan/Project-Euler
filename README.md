Solving the Project Euler challenges in MATLAB Cody to practice my MATLAB skills. 

Solutions 001-006 were validated using MATLAB R2023a. 
Solutions 007 and beyond were validated using MATLAB R2023b. 


## What is Project Euler
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.
